PyDTNN GPU Activations

If you want to add a new GPU activation layer:
    1) create a new Python file in this directory,
    2) define your GPU activation layer class as derived from ActivationGPU and, optionally, other Activation
       derived class,
    3) and, optionally, import your GPU activation layer on this file.
